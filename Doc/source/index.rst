Introduction
=============

This package provides a unified framework to generate the operators of electron and spin systems.
Based on this, it implements several algorithms, including:

* tight binding approximation (TBA) and Bogoliubov de Gennes (BdG) equations for fermionic systems,
* exact diagonalization (ED) for electron systems,
* cluster pertubation theory (CPT) and variational cluster approach (VCA) for fermionic systems,
* density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) for electron and spin systems.

It works with python 2.7, and requires several packages:

* numpy latest version
* scipy latest version
* mpi4py
